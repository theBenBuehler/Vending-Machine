Ben Buehler - Vending Machine
There are two versions text-based and simple GUI
Titles that start with VENDING MACHINE are text based
Titles that GUI are made with pTkinter

I like the logic of the text based versions better. I think they are more creative and interesting.
This projects represents my first experience with using pTkinter so it is not very sophisticated.

VARIABLES
items: dictionary of all 10 items in machine. Each dictionary contains a list [item name, cost, quantity]
layout: used in text version. Sets layout for menu screen
thing: returns a specific key in dictionary that contains the user item
change: float variable that is a running total of money owed to user
moneyInput: float variable where users declare(in dollars...with decimal points) how much money they input
changeList: declares all units of currency the machine can dispense.
changeNames: delcares all names for currency the machine can dispene (I may have been able to put this into a dictionary with changeList
FOR GUI VERSION
xxx.Text are labels
xxx.Button are buttons
xxxThis are buttons used to indicate the user is done entering texts in an input field
exxx are variables that hold entry fields

*****NOTES ON VARIABLES****
    In the GUI version I had to declare many variables and button names as global to get them to work correctly.



FUNCTIONS
showMenu() - prints menu screen
itemSelect() - checks to make sure the item the user selects is in the vending machine
itemBuy() - starts the sequence of buying, paying, and making change
makeChange() - called in itemBuy() to calculate and display change.
